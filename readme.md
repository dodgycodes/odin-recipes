The Odin Project: Recipes

In this project I will demonstrate what I have learned so far in regards to The Odin Project, HTML, Git and GitHub. 

This projects showcases the following:
- File structures in preperation for a HTML based website.
- Basic HTML boilerplate.
- Using various HTML elements and tags to work with and format text, links and images.
- This project will consist of a Homepage containing Hyperlinks that links to additional pages containing the recipes with detailed instructions and images showcasing the finished dish. 

Thank you.
